      <h3>NUS DID Gradshow event site</h3>
      <p>For the NUS DID Grad show 2016, a showcase website for the graduating batch was required. While there was the option to use an existing website builder, I decided to take on the task of developing it.</p>
      <p>You may visit the site
      <a href="http://did.nus.edu.sg/gradshows/2016/" target="_top">here</a>.</p>
      <h4><br/>My Role</h4>
      <p>I designed and developed the website on my own. Taking the opportunity to learn more about front-end development, I gained a better appreciation for responsive web dev and design.</p>
      <h4><br/>Tools</h4>
      <p>Sketch, HTML/CSS/JS</p>

      <p>VISA Design Storm is a 4-day workshop that seeks to envision VISA payment of the 21st century. It intends to inform and influence how people everywhere in the world will conduct VISA payments and how it will function as a bridge to evolving digital world.</p>

    <p><i>In collaboration with Essec Business School</i></p>
    <p><i>This or that</i> is a product discovery app that allows users to browse for products online without being overwhelmed by options. By reinventing the shopping experience as a comparison game, we can both collect the user's preferences while allowing them to browse.</p>
